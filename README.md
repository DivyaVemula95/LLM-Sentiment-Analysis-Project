# Sentiment Analysis Using DistilBERT

This project aims to build a sentiment analysis tool that leverages the pre-trained DistilBERT model for sequence classification. By seamlessly integrating Python's powerful NLP capabilities into the R programming environment using reticulate, the project allows for efficient sentiment analysis on textual data. The system includes functions for tokenizing inputs, performing sentiment analysis, and processing custom datasets. Visualizations are created to understand model performance, and the fine-tuned model and tokenizer are saved for future use.
